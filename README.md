Ad-Hoc-alg-simulation
=====================

Basic simulation code included AODV, LAR, GRID and our approach, GAR

This is the simulation code developed by Jiasen Lu, for the experiment purpose of the paper, A Novel Grid Based Ant
Colony routing in Ad-Hoc network. 

The code is only developed to simulated searching the route for the ad-hoc network or wireless sensor network. The code 
including the simulation of AODVm LAR, GRID and GAR.
